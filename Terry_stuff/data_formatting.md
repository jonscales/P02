When displaying database information from an SQLite database in Python, you have several options depending on your needs and the level of detail you want to present. Here are some common methods to display database information:

1. **Pretty-Printed Tabular Output**: You can use libraries like `prettytable` or `tabulate` to format query results into a visually appealing tabular format. These libraries make it easy to display rows and columns in a structured way.

   Example with `prettytable`:

   ```python
   from prettytable import PrettyTable
   import sqlite3

   conn = sqlite3.connect('your_database.db')
   cursor = conn.cursor()

   cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM your_table")
   rows = cursor.fetchall()

   table = PrettyTable()
   table.field_names = [desc[0] for desc in cursor.description]
   table.add_rows(rows)

   print(table)
   ```

2. **Custom Formatting**: You can manually format the query results using Python's string formatting capabilities. This allows you to have full control over the display format.

   Example:

   ```python
   conn = sqlite3.connect('your_database.db')
   cursor = conn.cursor()

   cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM your_table")
   rows = cursor.fetchall()

   for row in rows:
       print(f"ID: {row[0]}, Name: {row[1]}, ...")
   ```

3. **JSON or CSV Export**: If you want to export data for further analysis or reporting, you can query the data and export it as JSON or CSV. Python has built-in support for both formats.

   Example for CSV:

   ```python
   import csv
   import sqlite3

   conn = sqlite3.connect('your_database.db')
   cursor = conn.cursor()

   cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM your_table")
   rows = cursor.fetchall()

   with open('output.csv', 'w', newline='') as csvfile:
       csvwriter = csv.writer(csvfile)
       csvwriter.writerow([desc[0] for desc in cursor.description])
       csvwriter.writerows(rows)
   ```

4. **Interactive Displays**: If you're working in a Jupyter Notebook or an environment that supports rich interactive displays, you can use libraries like `pandas` to display dataframes interactively.

   Example with `pandas`:

   ```python
   import pandas as pd
   import sqlite3

   conn = sqlite3.connect('your_database.db')

   df = pd.read_sql_query("SELECT * FROM your_table", conn)
   df
   ```

The best method for displaying database information in SQLite using Python depends on your specific use case, whether you need interactive displays, further data processing, or simply a visually appealing tabular format. You can choose the method that best suits your needs and the environment in which you're working.


In SQLite, you can achieve similar functionality to `SHOW TABLES` and `DESCRIBE` commands, but they are not standard SQL commands like in some other database systems. SQLite provides alternative commands and queries to retrieve information about tables and their structure.

1. **List Tables**: To list all the tables in the current database, you can query the `sqlite_master` table, which contains metadata about database objects. Here's an example:

   ```python
   import sqlite3

   conn = sqlite3.connect('your_database.db')
   cursor = conn.cursor()

   cursor.execute("SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table';")
   tables = cursor.fetchall()

   for table in tables:
       print(table[0])
   ```

   This query retrieves the names of all tables in the database.

2. **Describe Table**: To describe the structure of a specific table, you can query the `PRAGMA table_info(table_name)` statement. Here's an example:

   ```python
   import sqlite3

   conn = sqlite3.connect('your_database.db')
   cursor = conn.cursor()

   cursor.execute("PRAGMA table_info(your_table_name);")
   table_info = cursor.fetchall()

   for column_info in table_info:
       column_name = column_info[1]
       data_type = column_info[2]
       is_nullable = "NULL" if column_info[3] == 0 else "NOT NULL"
       print(f"Column Name: {column_name}, Data Type: {data_type}, Nullable: {is_nullable}")
   ```

   This query retrieves information about columns in the specified table, including their names, data types, and nullability.

These are the SQLite-specific commands you can use to achieve functionality similar to `SHOW TABLES` and `DESCRIBE` in other databases. They allow you to list tables and describe the structure of a specific table in an SQLite database.
